## Overview

### The objectives

- Develop a system / page in web format where the user must authenticate himself, through an e-mail / password, previously registered, where in case of success, the system should display a page with the words "Welcome #UserName!".

- The layout will have to adapt to each screen size.

- Create, on the same authentication screen, a registration option, where the user, if not registered in the system, can effect his registration using: Username, E-mail and the desired Password. The password must contain at least one capital letter and one number. It should not be allowed to create two users with the same e-mails

## My process

### Built with

- ReactJS
- Fragment
- Tailwindcss
- NodeJS
- Npm
- Formik 
- Yup 
- Axios
- Cors
- Express
- MySQL
- Nodemon
- React-Router-Dom
- Js-Cookie

### What I learned

I learned to use formik and yup to make form and its validations with the help of Regex. Make front-to-back connections using Axios. Use Fragment to be able to store more than one component, use ReactJS Routes and how to use cookies to allow the user to access a page if their registration has been done correctly and how handle errors.
